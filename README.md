# SilhouetteLength
For using this code or algorithm, please cite Timotius et.al, "Silhouette-length-scaled gait parameters for motor functional analysis in mice and rats", eNeuro, 2019.

This repository includes the MATLAB file together with the CatWalk sample data for calculating silhouette length and area of rodents.
The calculated silhouette length is then used to normalize gait parameters.

File related to CatWalk data collected from mice:  MATLAB file: mice_sample.m;  Data: Data_Mice;  Run_statistics: mice_run_statistics_sample.xlsx;  Result: mice_results.xlsx

File related to CatWalk data collected from rats:  MATLAB file: rats_sample.m;  Data: Data_Rats;  Run_statistics: rats_run_statistics_sample.xlsx;  Result: rats_results.xlsx

For using this MATLAB code on other CatWalk data, please adjust according to the number of data and camera resolution.
